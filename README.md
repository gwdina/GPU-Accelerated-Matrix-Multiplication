# GPU-Accelerated-Matrix-Multiplication
This project demonstrates matrix multiplication accelerated on a GPU using NVIDIA's CUDA programming model. It is designed to compute the product of two large matrices in parallel, taking advantage of the GPUâ€™s massive threading capabilities to significantly outperform traditional CPU-based matrix multiplication.
